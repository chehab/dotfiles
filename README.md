## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Development/dotfiles`. The bootstrap script will symlink the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbuTariq/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```
